// Question 123: Create a loop that iterates through a string and stops when it finds the first vowel.
// Explain & TIP: To find a specific character in a string, you can iterate through each character and use a condition to check for vowels. The loop can stop once a vowel is found.
var str = "Bachelors";
var i = 0;
while (i < str.length) {
    console.log(str[i]);
    i++;
}
